# Abstract

The project developed is a social network for parties. In
this social network you can add pages for various social events
(birthdays, weddings, etc.). Likewise, in these pages you can add the
place of the event, the date, the time, etc. It is also possible to control
the number of attendees. So, attendees can access the event through
an invitation and can confirm or decline the invitation. Finally, at the
end of the party, photos can be uploaded to the page. The reason why
this project was raised was because it can have many forms of
interaction with other systems (Google Maps, Google Calendar,
Instagram, etc). Also, there is no web platform as such that brings
these elements together.
